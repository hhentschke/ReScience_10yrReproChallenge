## Contents

__rmouse__ is a collection of Matlab routines for time-and frequency domain analysis of multi-channel local field potential (LFP) data from rodent hippocampus, with a focus on phase-amplitude coupling of theta with gamma rhythms. The code been restructured and cleaned up to a minor degree, and basic functionality with Matlab R2020a has been verfied. For details, see the manual (in the directory), the original article, and the ReScience article.

__scripts_data__ contains scripts required for running data analysis using rmouse.

__scripts_paper__ contains scripts required for reproducing figures with key findings for the ReScience submission, plus detailed instructions how to accomplish this.

__paper__ contains the ReScience submission (Latex source and pdf), including figures.
