	abstract = {Oscillatory activity in the brain has been associated with a wide variety of cognitive processes including decision making, feedback processing, and working memory. The high temporal resolution provided by electroencephalography (EEG) enables the study of variation of oscillatory power and coupling across time. Various forms of neural synchrony across frequency bands have been suggested as the mechanism underlying neural binding. Recently, a considerable amount of work has focused on phase-amplitude coupling (PAC)– a form of cross-frequency coupling where the amplitude of a high frequency signal is modulated by the phase of low frequency oscillations. The existing methods for assessing PAC have some limitations including limited frequency resolution and sensitivity to noise, data length and sampling rate due to the inherent dependence on bandpass filtering. In this paper, we propose a new time-frequency based PAC (t-f PAC) measure that can address these issues. The proposed method relies on a complex time-frequency distribution, known as the Reduced Interference Distribution (RID)-Rihaczek distribution, to estimate both the phase and the envelope of low and high frequency oscillations, respectively. As such, it does not rely on bandpass filtering and possesses some of the desirable properties of time-frequency distributions such as high frequency resolution. The proposed technique is first evaluated for simulated data and then applied to an EEG speeded reaction task dataset. The results illustrate that the proposed time-frequency based PAC is more robust to varying signal parameters and provides a more accurate measure of coupling strength.},

	volume = {102},
	abstract = {Phasic GABAergic inhibition in hippocampus and neocortex falls into two kinetically distinct categories, GABAA,fast and GABAA,slow. In hippocampal area CA1, GABAA,fast is generally believed to underlie GABA oscillations, whereas the contribution of GABAA,slow to hippocampal rhythms has been speculative. Hypothesizing that GABAA receptors containing the beta3 subunit contribute to GABAA,slow inhibition, and that slow inhibitory synapses control excitability as well as contribute to network rhythms, we investigated the consequences of this subunit's absence on synaptic inhibition and network function. In pyramidal neurons of GABAA receptor beta3 subunit-deficient (beta3(-/-)) mice, spontaneous GABAA,slow IPSCs were much less frequent, and evoked GABAA,slow currents were much smaller than in wild type mice. Fittingly, long-lasting recurrent inhibition of population spikes was less powerful in the mutant, indicating that receptors containing beta3 contribute substantially to GABAA,slow currents in pyramidal neurons. By contrast, slow inhibitory control of GABAA,fast-producing interneurons was unaffected in beta3(-/-) mice. In vivo, hippocampal network activity was markedly different in the two genotypes. In beta3(-/-) mice, epileptiform activity was observed, and theta oscillations were weaker, slower, less regular and less well coordinated across laminae in compared to wild type mice, whereas gamma oscillations were weaker and faster. The amplitude modulation of gamma oscillation on theta frequency ('nesting') was preserved, but was less well coordinated with theta oscillations. With the caveat that seizure-induced changes in inhibitory circuits might have contributed to changes observed in the mutant animals, our results point to a strong contribution of beta3 subunits to slow GABAergic inhibition onto pyramidal neurons but not onto GABAA,fast-producing interneurons, and support different roles for these slow inhibitory synapses in the generation and coordination of hippocampal network rhythms},

	title = {Amnesic concentrations of the nonimmobilizer 1,2-dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane ({F6}, {2N}) and isoflurane alter hippocampal theta oscillations in vivo},
	volume = {106},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND:: Drug-induced temporary amnesia is one of the principal goals of general anesthesia. The nonimmobilizer 1,2-dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane (F6, also termed 2N) impairs hippocampus-dependent learning at relative, i.e., lipophilicity-corrected, concentrations similar to isoflurane. Hippocampal theta oscillations facilitate mnemonic processes in vivo and synaptic plasticity (a cellular model of memory) in vitro and are thought to represent a circuit level phenomenon that supports memory encoding. Therefore, the authors investigated the effects of F6 and isoflurane on theta oscillations (4-12 Hz). METHODS:: Thirteen adult rats were implanted with multichannel depth electrodes to measure the microelectroencephalogram and were exposed to a range of concentrations of isoflurane and F6 spanning the concentrations that produce amnesia. Five of these animals also underwent control experiments without drug injection. The authors recorded the behavioral state and hippocampal field potentials. They confirmed the electrode location postmortem by histology. RESULTS:: The tested concentrations for isoflurane and F6 ranged from 0.035\% to 0.77\% and from 0.5\% to 3.6\%, respectively. Isoflurane increased the fraction of time that the animals remained immobile, consistent with sedation, whereas F6 had the opposite effect. Electroencephalographic power in the theta band was less when the animals were immobile than when they explored their environment. F6 suppressed the power of oscillations in the theta band. Isoflurane slowed theta oscillations without reducing total power in the theta band. CONCLUSIONS:: Drug-induced changes in theta oscillations may be a common basis for amnesia produced by F6 and isoflurane. The different patterns suggest that these drugs alter network activity by acting on different molecular and/or cellular targets},
